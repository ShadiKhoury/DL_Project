# DL_Project
Deep Learning Project, DL interpolation of multiple feature importance methods on real clinical data 

The Script is built from Multiple functions that need to be run in order matter ( Top --> Bottom). these functions are grouped into one Cell that runs most of them together to generate our results.

You would have to push your Data into the Train_data, and Test_data parameters to use this. and Run the script cell by cell in order to execute the full interpolation
